# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security issue with a ZeroDep package, please open a new private security vulnerability report through the [ZeroDep GitHub Security Reporting](https://github.com/cdepage/zerodep/security) mechanism.

Alternatively, reach out to us at [security@zerodep.app](mailto:security@zerodep.app), we will then open a GitHub Security Advisory for tracking the fix on your behalf.

Please DO NOT post potential security vulnerability information as a GitHub Issue.
