# Contributing

We are open to, and grateful for, any contributions made by the community. By contributing to @zerodep you agree to abide by the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT).

Any of the following are welcome:

- defect/flaw identification/reporting
- suggestions for improvement (code, documentation, other)
- enhancements to existing code
- new features/capabilities
- testing improvements
- automation enhancements
- supportive comments (our favourite)

## Quality Controls

Our tooling includes:

- prettier - for code formatting
- eslint - code linter to catch software quality issues
- jest - for unit testing and code coverage
- nx - for monorepo management
- codefactor - for CI code linting
- snyk - for security vulnerability analysis and reporting

Our quality guidelines require very good to excellent unit test coverage with tests that are actually valuable and appropriately exercise the code under test. While we accept code contributions that do not have sufficient test coverage, we will not merge them into the main branch until test coverage sufficiently comprehensive. This "last mile" may be written by core maintainers or other contributors.
